# When Do You Come?

A [Startup Weekend 2013 Bratislava](http://bratislava.startupweekend.org/) project, this application has been designed to track the position of a user, holding his/her smartphone, going to a specific location. On the other end of the application is another user, seeing estimated time till the first user arrives at the specified place. With the help of a nice web interface. 

## Why?

We developed this project as a proof of concept application in which a web browser and [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) can be used to track phone's location (GPS or network based). The origianl idea belongs to [Martin Polacko](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=200411281) who invited @lamosty, @darjanin and @TomasJendek to implement his idea as a part of a Startup Weekend event in Bratislava, Slovakia.

We accomplished the goal in two and a half days with not much of a sleep but happy nonetheless, winning the **second** place, with a working MVP.

## Technology

We didn't have much time for tech speculation so we went the classical road: Ruby on Rails for the backend and CoffeeScript compiled to JS for the frontend (Geolocation API). 

## Current State

After winning the contest, we unfortunately stopped our work on the app. Its website was shut down and only thing that left was a Bitbucket git repo. I decided to open source it so here it is. If you are in a good mood, you can deploy the app and play with it. If you do, send me a link please so I can put it here.
